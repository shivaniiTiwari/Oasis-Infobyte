In only 304 matches, he completed this. At a batting average of more than 50, he also made history by becoming the first hitter to accomplish this feat. This occurred in Colombo during the lone T20I match versus Sri Lanka. Additionally, Kohli is the 33rd player to have completed this many international runs.
                                        Along with being a fantastic hitter, Virat Kohli is also a strong leader.

A captain from India has won the most games in this format with this total. With 13 victories under his belt, he also has the most wins of any Indian skipper in away games. As the captain of India’s Test matches, Kohli also has the highest win %

The watershed moment in his career came in the 2011/12 tri-series match against Sri Lanka. It was a must-win game and India needed to win the match with a bonus point to qualify for the final, which Australia had already made to.

                                            Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara's counter-attack meant India had to chase down 320 runs in 40 overs. Sehwag, Sachin, Gautam Gambhir all gave starts and played crucial innings but it was Virat Kohli's night. Every Sri Lankan bowler went the distance, Kohli played one of the most calculative-explosive knocks of ODI history. It was the beginning of the chase master, which Virat Kohli has become over the years. Kohli played an unbeaten knock of 133 runs off just 86 balls, hitting 16 fours and a couple of sixes as India chased the total down in just 36.4 overs.

Another David Warner special in the second innings meant India needed 364 runs to win but they had ample time. Kohli's aggressive mindset meant they were going for the target. After losing two early wickets, Vijay and Kohli stitched a 185-run partnership and India were well on course for a historic chase.</p>

                                            While Yuvraj Singh supported Virat Kohli for a while, he took went after scoring 21 runs and the Indian team required 67 runs off the last 6 overs when skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni joined him.
                                            
                                            One of the best accelerators in the game, Kohli then just launched an attack on the Australian bowling line-up showing a wide range of his shots and both of them helped India achieve the target and qualify for the semi-finals of the 2016 event.
                                            
                                            Kohli isn't your crash-bang T20 cricketer, he never was. He's your slow-death batter, who will seep into the innings slowly and then attack. Kohli remained unbeaten on 82 runs off just 51 balls.

                                        <p class="description">This isn't about Kohli the batsman, but the captain. Test wins don't come easy, especially the overseas ones, that too in SENA countries and above all in South Africa. South Africa had won the first two games of the series and had taken a 2-0 unassailable lead in the three-match series.

                                            This was the first series where India unleashed the trio of Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah and Ishant Sharma on the opponents. They were able to take 40 wickets in the first two games and needed to take 20 more and with some help of their batsmen, they could inspire India to a win at Johannesburg, where the ball was flying, seaming, swinging and doing all sorts of things.
                                            
                                            Kohli and Pujara smashed half-centuries but India were bowled out for 187 runs batting first. India bowlers replied in style Bumrah taking a fifer and Bhuvneshwar Kumar three wickets, bowling the hosts for 194.
                                            
                                            A seven-run lead wasn't much but India needed a strong batting performance. Another good score of 41 by Kohli and contributions from Rahane, Shami and Bhuvneshwar meant, India scored 247 runs setting up a challenging 241-run target for South Africa on a deteriorating surface,
                                            
                                            This time Shami took a fifer as India's four-pronged pace battery dismissed South Africa for just 177 as the visitors won a Test in South Africa..</p>
